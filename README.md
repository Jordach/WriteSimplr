# WriteSimplr
This is a personal program designed for a hybrid of note taking, writing, wiki styling internal linking, markdown compatible and rich text editing. I've open sourced it as MIT due to it's nature of being cobbled together.

It was designed as a homage to late 90s early 2000s MS Word due to it's appearance and toolbar layout, just with "modern" changes.
